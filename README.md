# PDF Companion üìöüîç

**PDF Companion** is an advanced application designed to revolutionize the way you interact with your PDF files. It not only brings your documents to life but also provides insightful answers to your queries, supporting both text and voice interactions.

This application leverages state-of-the-art AI models for its core functionalities:
- **Google's Generative AI** (Gemini model via `langchain-google-genai`) for question answering.
- **Deepgram ASR** for transcribing voice queries from audio files.
- **ElevenLabs TTS** for providing spoken audio responses.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Intelligent PDF Analysis**: Extracts text from uploaded PDF documents and splits it into manageable chunks.
*   **Advanced Embeddings**: Creates a searchable vector store using FAISS with high-quality embeddings from Google.
*   **AI-Powered Question Answering**: Utilizes Google's advanced language models (Gemini) to understand and answer questions based on the PDF content.
*   **Flexible Query Input**:
    *   Type your questions directly in a text input field.
    *   Upload an audio file (e.g., WAV, MP3, M4A) containing your voice query, transcribed by Deepgram.
*   **Comprehensive Responses**:
    *   View detailed textual answers generated by the LLM.
    *   Listen to spoken responses, generated by ElevenLabs, for a hands-free experience.
*   **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run PDF Companion locally:

### 1. API Keys

To use the full capabilities of PDF Companion, you will need API keys from the following services:

*   **Google**: For Generative AI models (e.g., Gemini).
    *   Enable the "Generative Language API" in your Google Cloud console.
    *   Ensure your account has billing enabled if required by the models/features you use.
*   **Deepgram**: For Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
*   **ElevenLabs**: For Text-to-Speech (TTS).

You can set these API keys as environment variables:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key"
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="your_deepgram_api_key"
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="your_elevenlabs_api_key"
```

Alternatively, if the environment variables are not set, the application will provide input fields in the sidebar for you to enter the keys manually when you run the app.

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies using `pipenv`:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TAHMID37/PDF-Companion.git 
# (or your repository URL if it's a fork/different location)

# Navigate to the project directory
cd PDF-Companion

# Install pipenv if you haven't already
pip install pipenv

# Install project dependencies
# For a production-like setup (recommended for running):
pipenv install --deploy --ignore-pipfile

# Or, for a development setup (includes test dependencies like pytest):
# pipenv install --dev
```

### 3. Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit application using `pipenv`:

```bash
pipenv run streamlit run app.py
```

The application should open in your default web browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

PDF Companion relies on several key Python libraries:

*   **Streamlit**: For creating the interactive web application interface.
*   **Langchain**: As the core framework for building LLM-powered applications, managing chains, and integrating components.
*   **`langchain-google-genai`**: For specific integration with Google's Generative AI models.
*   **`langchain-community`**: For community-contributed Langchain components like document loaders and vector stores.
*   **Deepgram SDK (`deepgram-sdk`)**: For interacting with the Deepgram ASR API.
*   **ElevenLabs SDK (`elevenlabs`)**: For interacting with the ElevenLabs TTS API.
*   **FAISS (`faiss-cpu`)**: For efficient similarity search in the vector store.
*   **PyPDFLoader (`pypdf`)**: For loading and parsing PDF documents.
*   **Dotenv (`python-dotenv`)**: For managing environment variables.

For a complete list of dependencies and their versions, please refer to the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` in this repository.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Ensure API Keys are Set**:
    *   Set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`, and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` as environment variables (recommended).
    *   Or, enter them via the sidebar when the app starts if prompted. The Google API Key is required for core functionality.
2.  **Upload a PDF**: Use the file uploader to select and upload the PDF document you want to interact with.
3.  **Ask Questions**:
    *   **Text Input**: Type your question into the text input field.
    *   **Voice Input**: If you have a Deepgram API key, upload an audio file containing your question. The transcribed text will be used as the query.
4.  **Get Responses**:
    *   The application will display the textual answer generated by Google's LLM.
    *   If you have an ElevenLabs API key, a "üîä Play Response Audio" button will appear, allowing you to listen to the spoken version of the answer.
